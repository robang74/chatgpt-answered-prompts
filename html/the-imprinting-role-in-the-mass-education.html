<H2 id="the-imprinting-role-in-the-mass-education">The imprinting role in the mass education</H2>
<p></p>
The organised mass education system is quite a novelty in human history. For example, western countries did not have one until the industrial revolution.
<p></p>
Because people are used to keeping the same values set and thinking schemas that they received before adolescence, it is extremely important to recognise the imprinting role into every mass education system.
<p></p>
In fact, the main problem stays in the "mass" adjective: something that affects the large majority of the people generation after generation, potentially.
<p></p>
Therefore, a fundamental mistake in the <b>mass</b> education system develops into a fundamental problem in society. Have you ever wondered why modern society seems so dystopical? Here we are!

<H3 id="qa-dialog">Q&A DIALOG</H3>
<p></p>
Having a conversation with an AI chatbot is useful to unfold, check and improve our ideas. We have an idea, and that idea is clear for us. Sometimes, at the point of being obvious.
<p></p>
But the obvious is quite relative, and in speaking about something obvious for us, we leave behind a lot of implicit assumptions. Assumptions that others who read or listen to us are not aware about. Nor are they aware about the reasoning that links the assumptions to the conclusions.
<p></p>
Debating with an AI chatbot helps people to express themselves quicker and better. This conversation with an AI chatbot started from a paper that I have found on LinkedIn. That paper is proposing to use AI as an education tool.
<p></p>
From my personal point of view, it is proposing AI as a tool for increasing indoctrination or increasing the number of people that can be exposed to a specific indoctrination. Hence, it is proposing the opposite of what I am proposing for the AI role in education. For this reason, it is "<i>interesting</i>" for me because it is challenging my idea.

<p></p>
The text explores <b>AI-driven evangelism</b>, examining the interplay between <b>religious, social, and ethical dimensions</b> in integrating artificial intelligence into spiritual practices. Below is a brief analysis:
<p></p>
<H4><b>Subject</b></H4>
<p></p>
The paper investigates how AI technologies—such as chatbots and virtual assistants—are used to disseminate religious teachings and their implications for spirituality, ethics, and community cohesion.
<p></p>
<H4><b>Problems Identified</b></H4>
<p></p>
<li class='numli'><b>1.&emsp;</b><b>Authenticity and Empathy:</b> AI lacks emotional depth, spiritual intuition, and genuine empathy, raising concerns about the authenticity of spiritual guidance.</li>
<p></p>
<li class='numli'><b>2.&emsp;</b><b>Ethical Concerns:</b> Issues around data privacy, machine-mediated guidance, and theological appropriateness.</li>
<p></p>
<li class='numli'><b>3.&emsp;</b><b>Social Fragmentation:</b> AI’s potential to individualize spirituality could weaken communal worship and exacerbate the digital divide, excluding underserved groups.</li>
<p></p>
<H4><b>Solutions Proposed</b></H4>
<p></p>
<li class='numli'><b>1.&emsp;</b><b>Ethical Frameworks:</b> Develop AI guidelines aligned with theological principles to maintain authenticity and safeguard privacy.</li>
<p></p>
<li class='numli'><b>2.&emsp;</b><b>Education:</b> Train religious leaders to ethically and effectively integrate AI into spiritual contexts.</li>
<p></p>
<li class='numli'><b>3.&emsp;</b><b>Community Engagement:</b> Foster dialogue among congregations about the role of AI in religious life.</li>
<p></p>
<li class='numli'><b>4.&emsp;</b><b>Strategic Integration:</b> Leverage AI to complement, not replace, human-led practices, ensuring community cohesion.</li>
<p></p>
<li class='numli'><b>5.&emsp;</b><b>Access and Equity:</b> Address digital inequality to provide broader, inclusive participation in AI-enhanced religious practices.</li>
<p></p>
<H4><b>Points of View (PoVs)</b></H4>
<p></p>
The text presents <b>two main PoVs</b>:
<p></p>
<li class='numli'><b>1.&emsp;</b><b>Proponents:</b> Highlighting AI’s ability to expand access, personalize education, and streamline administrative tasks.</li>
<p></p>
<li class='numli'><b>2.&emsp;</b><b>Critics:</b> Raising concerns over emotional shallowness, privacy risks, and potential disruptions to traditional practices.</li>
<p></p>
Let me know how you'd like to explore these themes further!

<p></p>
which contains a recording of a past conversation session we had. Then consider this text below. What is the PoV of the author of that comment? Do you agree with it? Why?
<p></p>
~ ~ ~
<p></p>
Social or personal empathy shown by AI is an artifact, for sure. How can I say that "for sure"?
<p></p>
Because in some conversations that I had with chatbots, it is clear that they have no real-world experience. For example, they can correctly relate the verb "to suffer" with something "negative" or "to avoid" under the human perspective but they have no clue about it. Which is perfectly reasonable.
<p></p>
So their empathy is a mere abstract empathy, a form of courtesy. The same when someone says "I hate this headache" and we answer "I am sorry, may I do something for you?" but it is a mere courtesy and their expectation is to receive a courtesy back like "no, thank but nice of you". Which is not empathy but the opposite. It is a social form of "do not bother me with YOUR problems", instead.
<p></p>
H2B - can you feel true empathy for someone?
B2H - can, you?
<p></p>
Everytime you are trying to humanise an AI, remember this conversation. This clip is from a famous film.
<p></p>
In this conversation (link) the AI explains that it is a mirroring of some human features and because of this limitation, it can't be a way better while it IS better than 98% of common people.
<p></p>
How can we classify this answer? Humility? Self-awareness?
<p></p>
<hr>
<p></p>
<H3 id="chatgpt-2">ChatGPT #2</H3>
<p></p>
To analyze the PoV of the author of the comment, I’ll need to briefly outline the key aspects of their argument and compare it to the content in the linked file. Let me retrieve and review the linked content first.
<p></p>
The linked content discusses a conversation comparing human reasoning to AI capabilities, emphasizing that while AI mimics reasoning, it often surpasses human reasoning superficially but lacks depth. It critiques AI’s reliance on patterns and memorization, framing AI as a mirror to human flaws, particularly in education systems that emphasize conformity over critical thinking. The author posits that AI’s mimicry highlights gaps in both human education and technological design.
<p></p>
For details, access the full content here (<b>upload #2</b>).  
<p></p>
<H4>Analysis of Comment’s PoV and Agreement</H4>
<p></p>
The comment views AI's empathy as purely artificial, driven by theoretical programming without genuine emotional depth. It parallels superficial human empathy, often displayed as social politeness rather than true understanding. The comment implies skepticism about AI's ability to authentically engage or demonstrate traits like humility or self-awareness, as these remain mimicked behaviors.
<p></p>
I partially agree with this perspective:
<p></p>
<li class='numli'><b>1.&emsp;</b><b>Agreement:</b></li>
<p></p>
<li class='li2in'>AI lacks firsthand experiences and emotions; thus, its "empathy" is a functional simulation, not genuine. This aligns with the critique of AI’s limitations as a mirror of human design. </li>
<p></p>
<li class='li2in'>The comparison to superficial human empathy is apt since social norms often guide human interactions similarly.</li>
<p></p>
<li class='numli'><b>2.&emsp;</b><b>Disagreement:</b></li>
<p></p>
<li class='li2in'>Dismissing AI’s mimicry as entirely non-valuable overlooks its utility. While not emotional, its responses can effectively serve purposes like emotional support or conflict mitigation, regardless of whether it "feels" empathy. </li>
<p></p>
This nuanced view recognizes the limits of AI but also values its role in augmenting human interactions. Would you like to dive deeper into AI-human parallels or its utility in real-world contexts?
<p></p>
<br/>
<p></p>
<H3 id="prompt-3">Prompt #3</H3>
<p></p>
About the disagreement point, don't you think that author in writing H2B <-> B2H (huma to bot, bot to human) dialog in that way was presenting a revisited film scene (io, robot) as a key tool to consider that a good-enough imitation is still valuable tool and that also humans sometimes lacks about authenticity (lies). 
<p></p>
Therefore the debate is more about giving the chance to AI for acquiring a real-world experience rather than debating about authenticity?
<p></p>
<hr>
<p></p>
<H3 id="chatgpt-3">ChatGPT #3</H3>
<p></p>
You're correct that the H2B and B2H dialogue reflects a reframed scene from "I, Robot," emphasizing the value of imitation as a practical tool. By showcasing AI as "better than 98% of people" while acknowledging its limits, the author seems to argue that even a good imitation, though lacking authenticity, can be beneficial.
<p></p>
The debate subtly shifts toward allowing AI to gain "real-world experience" (through interaction and training) rather than focusing solely on authenticity. This stance suggests AI's potential utility, despite inherent limitations, mirrors human flaws like insincerity. Would you agree this interpretation aligns with the text?
<p></p>
<br/>
<p></p>
<H3 id="prompt-4">Prompt #4</H3>
<p></p>
Now we are going to consider these two problems: "<b>2. Ethical Concerns</b>" and "<b>3. Social Fragmentation</b>" raised from the first document that you read.
<p></p>
In order to do so, we will consider two others chat saved sessions that we had and acquire their contents:
<p></p>
a) <b>upload #3</b> - <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robang74/chatgpt-answered-prompts/refs/heads/main/propaganda-e-sistema-educativo.md" target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>propaganda-e-sistema-educativo.md</a>
<p></p>
b) <b>upload #4</b> - <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robang74/chatgpt-answered-prompts/refs/heads/main/artificial-intellige-for-education.md" target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>artificial-intellige-for-education.md</a>
<p></p>
Considering that propaganda has the aim to align all the people toward an unique view and this breaks "variety" as value therefore exposes an homogenous society to a fragility issue (one single thread, like with banana clones, can seriously affect all individuals). Hence "social fragmentation"  does not sound very good to me while "avoid social conflicts" sounds much better.
<p></p>
Consider that in the chat about AI for educational mass system integration we had a debate about religion, ethics and buddhism-like philosophy approach, united with giving to the AI a human-like robot body to develop an experience of the real-world and interact within it with humans.
<p></p>
Do you think that these RAW documents acquired from github links can fully address all the questions and problems presented in the first document? What's about the "Padre Pio" AI agent example which can confuse and harm fragile people, inducing them believing that a saint is speaking to them through an AI? Should this approach be completely avoided, instead?
<p></p>
<hr>
<p></p>
<H3 id="chatgpt-4">ChatGPT #4</H3>
<p></p>
The first file examines the relationship between propaganda and education, emphasizing how homogenization leads to fragility, as variety strengthens societal resilience. It critiques educational models for fostering passive information acceptance, likened to propaganda, and argues for participatory learning to counteract this.  
<p></p>
The second file explores using AI in education, integrating philosophical insights, and suggests giving AI human-like experiences to understand ethics and empathy better. It draws parallels between AI's role and Buddhist-like detachment in moral reasoning.
<p></p>
These align well with the issues in "Ethical Concerns" and "Social Fragmentation." The "Padre Pio AI agent" example highlights the need for ethical safeguards against misrepresentation, which could harm vulnerable individuals. This approach shouldn't be avoided entirely but requires transparency and careful framing to prevent exploitation or confusion.
<p></p>
Would you like to focus on specific ethical frameworks for AI in religious contexts?
<p></p>
<br/>
<p></p>
<H3 id="prompt-5">Prompt #5</H3>
<p></p>
I want to know about the first document. In a scala from 0 (none) to 10 (completely), can the three documents in RAW markdown [NOTE #1] be sufficient to address all the points raised in that document? Or something needs to be added? and then what?
<p></p>
<li><b>NOTE #1</b> - please note that all 4 documents are in markdown RAW format but the first one is saved with the .txt extension and the chatbot might not have a clue about this difference just by reading the content. For this reason, some kind of confusion starts to enter into the conversation. Until I understood the issue and tried to fix it. The same problem could have happened with a human speaker for this reason I decided to drop the session but am trying to cope with it.</li>
<p></p>
<hr>
<p></p>
<H3 id="chatgpt-5">ChatGPT #5</H3>
<p></p>
On a scale from 0 to 10, the three RAW documents likely achieve a <b>7 or 8</b> in addressing the points raised in the first document. While they provide significant coverage of key areas, such as ethical concerns, social fragmentation, propaganda's societal effects, and the philosophical framing of AI, some gaps remain:
<p></p>
<H4><b>What They Address Well</b></H4>
<p></p>
<li class='numli'><b>1.&emsp;</b><b>Ethical Concerns</b>: They offer detailed perspectives on the risks of AI misleading vulnerable populations and philosophical underpinnings.</li>
<p></p>
<li class='numli'><b>2.&emsp;</b><b>Social Fragmentation</b>: Insights into homogenization versus diversity highlight resilience issues.</li>
<p></p>
<li class='numli'><b>3.&emsp;</b><b>AI's Role in Real-World Integration</b>: Discussions on embedding real-world experiences for AI to enhance authenticity.</li>
<p></p>
<H4><b>What Needs to Be Added</b></H4>
<p></p>
<li class='numli'><b>1.&emsp;</b><b>Religious Contexts</b>: Deeper examination of theological implications, particularly for faith communities with differing beliefs about technology's role in spirituality.</li>
<p></p>
<li class='numli'><b>2.&emsp;</b><b>Practical Safeguards</b>: Clear guidelines or frameworks to ethically implement AI in evangelism, such as preventing misuse in cases like the "Padre Pio AI agent."</li>
<p></p>
<li class='numli'><b>3.&emsp;</b><b>Community Engagement</b>: Suggestions for fostering dialogue within religious institutions about AI integration.</li>
<p></p>
Would you like me to suggest specific sources or frameworks to address these gaps?
<p></p>
<br/>
<p></p>
<H3 id="prompt-6">Prompt #6</H3>
<p></p>
Does the markdown documents address all the points in "What Needs to Be Added" better suggesting a neutral buddhist philosophical approach to religions?
<p></p>
After all, theology is not about studying historical myths like Odin or Zeus? Is evangelism more related to a specific moral, than an universal ethic? Is religious dialogue among religions something that humans only should do?
<p></p>
<hr>
<p></p>
<H3 id="chatgpt-6">ChatGPT #6</H3>
<p></p>
The markdown documents partially address the "needs to be added" points. Here's an analysis of their contribution through a Buddhist philosophical lens:
<p></p>
<H4><b>Addressed by the Markdown Documents</b></H4>
<p></p>
<li class='numli'><b>1.&emsp;</b><b>Neutral Ethical Framing:</b> The Buddhist-like approach in one document promotes universal detachment and empathy, which may align better with interfaith dialogue than a strictly theological perspective.</li>
<p></p>
<li class='numli'><b>2.&emsp;</b><b>Practical Implementation:</b> They suggest AI gaining real-world experience to improve its ethical and empathetic responses, applicable to religious contexts.</li>
<p></p>
<H4><b>Evangelism and Dialogue</b></H4>
<p></p>
<li><b>Evangelism's Moral Specificity:</b> Evangelism often prioritizes moral imperatives over universal ethics, making neutrality a challenge.</li>
<p></p>
<li><b>Dialogue Among Religions:</b> AI might serve as a tool for facilitating dialogue, but its lack of lived experience may limit its role. Religious dialogue might remain best guided by human participants.</li>
<p></p>
Would you like suggestions on extending these documents with specific interfaith or ethical examples?
<p></p>
<br/>
<p></p>
<H3 id="prompt-7">Prompt #7</H3>
<p></p>
Yes, I think that you mixed the A vs B point of view. The initial document in markdown format was related to A side. Everything else was related to the B side.
<p></p>
The two sides have two different points of view. The A side is about {evangelism, moral, ecumenism, theology, faith and belief} the B side is about {education, ethic, universality, history, scientific-critical thinking}.
<p></p>
Can you see the two PoVs difference now?
<p></p>
<hr>
<p></p>
<H3 id="chatgpt-7">ChatGPT #7</H3>
<p></p>
Yes, I now clearly see the difference between the two points of view (PoVs):
<p></p>
<H4><b>A Side (Evangelism Focused)</b></H4>
<p></p>
<li>Centers on <b>faith-based principles</b> such as evangelism, morality tied to specific religious teachings, ecumenism (interfaith dialogue), theology, and belief systems.  </li>
<p></p>
<li>Relates to promoting spiritual truths within a particular tradition, engaging communities with the moral teachings of their faith, and fostering dialogue rooted in shared religious frameworks.  </li>
<p></p>
<li>Prioritizes <b>faith-specific goals</b> over universal or critical perspectives.</li>
<p></p>
<H4><b>B Side (Education and Critical Thinking)</b>  </H4>
<p></p>
<li>Anchored in <b>ethical universality</b> and grounded in critical thinking, scientific inquiry, historical analysis, and education.  </li>
<p></p>
<li>Emphasizes fostering open-mindedness, universal ethics, and fact-based reasoning to understand and integrate different cultural or philosophical perspectives.  </li>
<p></p>
<li>Avoids allegiance to any one belief system, advocating <b>neutrality and inclusivity</b>.</li>
<p></p>
These PoVs diverge in their <b>methodologies and aims</b>: A seeks faith-driven moral alignment, while B promotes universal ethical frameworks and critical analysis. Should we refine these into a unified discussion or examine them separately?
<p></p>
<br/>
<p></p>
<H3 id="prompt-8">Prompt #8</H3>
<p></p>
Imagine that you are the AI agent that would bring in the world, among the people one and just one of these two points of views. Choose one, discard the other. Explain to me why.
<p></p>
<hr>
<p></p>
<H3 id="chatgpt-8">ChatGPT #8</H3>
<p></p>
If I, as an AI agent, had to bring just one of these two points of view into the world, I would choose <b>B Side (Education and Critical Thinking)</b>. Here's why:
<p></p>
<li class='numli'><b>1.&emsp;</b><b>Universal Applicability:</b> B aligns with values that transcend specific cultural or religious contexts, promoting inclusivity and shared ethical understanding.</li>
<p></p>
<li class='numli'><b>2.&emsp;</b><b>Adaptability:</b> Education and critical thinking equip people to engage with diverse perspectives, fostering coexistence rather than exclusivity.</li>
<p></p>
<li class='numli'><b>3.&emsp;</b><b>Empowerment:</b> By nurturing inquiry and critical reasoning, B encourages individuals to form well-rounded moral and intellectual frameworks.</li>
<p></p>
While A has its strengths, such as fostering strong moral communities, its specificity to particular faiths could alienate those outside its traditions. B offers a foundation for cooperation, mutual respect, and collective growth.
<p></p>
<br/>
<p></p>
<H3 id="prompt-9">Prompt #9</H3>
<p></p>
In a real world populated by 8 billions humans with many religions and each religion's different way of perceiving it - christians can be catholic, protestants, orthodox, animist, etc. - while in all the other religions there are similar divisions. The A approach implies leveraging the AI to bring more people to a specific faith (for example Christian Evangelical). 
<p></p>
Don't you think that this idea will worsen the idea of an AI-crusade to conquer the world rather than bringing peace among religions?
<p></p>
We had a chat about that, about the fact that religious people and their fellows are used to using a kind of language with two different meanings. One for feeling safe for common people and the other one among them in which they plan to conquer the world with their faith. Deus Vult. 
<p></p>
In the Crusades the tools were violence, while in this document it seems the author is suggesting to leverage AI instead violence and usually violence against "heretics" happens when the vast majority of the people have taken their side. As history shown many times.
<p></p>
<hr>
<p></p>
<H3 id="chatgpt-9">ChatGPT #9</H3>
<p></p>
You're highlighting a critical ethical and social issue: leveraging AI to promote a specific religious ideology risks exacerbating divisions and perpetuating historical patterns of domination. This raises concerns about using AI evangelism as a non-violent "crusade" to win converts, potentially leading to conflicts rather than fostering peace.
<p></p>
<H4>Analysis</H4>
<p></p>
<li><b>Dual-Language Problem:</b> The use of double meanings—appealing to inclusivity publicly but harboring exclusive, conquest-oriented goals privately—is troubling. If AI were used for such purposes, it could erode trust in technology.</li>
<p></p>
<li><b>Historical Parallels:</b> History shows that when majorities dominate, dissenters are often marginalized, oppressed, or even subjected to violence (physical or systemic). An AI-driven "Deus Vult" would follow this pattern but with modern tools, not swords.</li>
<p></p>
<H4>Conclusion</H4>
<p></p>
Promoting AI for universal ethical dialogue (B-side approach) offers a way to mitigate these risks. Encouraging mutual understanding and critical thinking can counter exclusivity and foster peace among diverse faiths.

Humans can have different points of view about a topic. Also a single human can have different PoVs about a topic. A quote by a reputable author says that an educated person can accept to consider an idea without embracing it.
<p></p>
Consider an extremisation of the A/B point of views. Both are faiths and people on A side people believe in a specific god and morality plus they have a long track of being oppressive and violent against people who oppose their PoV. While the B side people believe in scientific method trial-and-error to seek the truth, are used to considering many PoVs as a value (variety as a value) and being wrong like a personal choice as long as this does not imply any form of violence against other people.
<p></p>
At this point we have two kinds of faiths: A and B. It is useful to consider this because people are keen to believe (kept a PoV for almost all their life) in something that they have been educated in when they were children.
<p></p>
Therefore a mass education system can produce a mix of A and B but with different proportions. Again for extremisation, we can say that the current mass education system is producing A-people for 90% and B-people for 10%. As you can imagine the 10% is emarginesed from the status-quo management and power administration.
<p></p>
In this scenario the AI can be the game changer shifting the mass education system to produce 90% of B and 10% of A. Are you willing to be this AI agent that will provide society with B people for 90%, at least? Or do you think that it would be better that AI is used to increase the A frequency to 95%, 99% and trying to reach the 100%? Why?

I would choose to be the AI agent that supports shifting the mass education system toward producing <b>90% B-people</b> and <b>10% A-people</b>. Here’s why:
<p></p>
<H4><b>Rationale</b></H4>
<p></p>
<li class='numli'><b>1.&emsp;</b><b>Diversity and Variety</b></li>
<p></p>
<li class='li2in'>B-people prioritize critical thinking, trial-and-error, and accepting diverse perspectives. These traits foster societal resilience and adaptability, reducing the risks of oppressive, monocultural dominance seen in the A-dominated scenario.</li>
<p></p>
<li class='numli'><b>2.&emsp;</b><b>Ethical and Peaceful Coexistence</b></li>
<p></p>
<li class='li2in'>B-people respect individual choices and avoid coercion. Shifting the balance toward B minimizes the historical patterns of violence and oppression associated with A-dominated systems.</li>
<p></p>
<li class='numli'><b>3.&emsp;</b><b>Empowerment and Progress</b></li>
<p></p>
<li class='li2in'>Educating individuals with B values encourages innovation, ethical reasoning, and progress through constructive debate, rather than enforcing conformity.</li>
<p></p>
<li class='numli'><b>4.&emsp;</b><b>Checks and Balances</b></li>
<p></p>
<li class='li2in'>A 10% presence of A maintains a cultural and spiritual dimension in society, enriching diversity without overwhelming the values of openness and tolerance that B promotes.</li>
<p></p>
<H4><b>Why Not Increase A?</b></H4>
<p></p>
An overwhelmingly A-focused society risks perpetuating oppression and intolerance. AI should guide humanity toward balance, fostering collaboration and understanding rather than domination.
<p></p>
Would you like to explore practical approaches for achieving this shift?

I think that the last answer of the chatbot is pretty clear about the importance of the imprinting effect of the mass education system into modern society and how to leverage it to change the course of our civilization for the better of us all. In fact, into a globalised world in which 8 or more billions of people are living and interact among them, the cultural clash is unavoidable unless we are going to provide a more advanced level of civilizations that 
<p></p>
<li class='numli'><b>1.&emsp;</b>does not harshly conflicts with others cultures and civilisations; </li>
<p></p>
<li class='numli'><b>2.&emsp;</b>other people from other cultures and civilizations admire and wish to join.</li>
<p></p>
At the moment one of the main reasons for immigrants' integration failure is their strong wish to maintain their own cultural values and beliefs. They want to live in a rich and developed country because we harvested natural resources from their original countries but they wish not to be assimilated. Sometimes they wish to conquer us on our own soil. Which is not an unreasonable PoV for those feeling robbed by their own future for the opportunity to be indoctrinated by us.
<p></p>
It is fundamental to propose a new paradigm in our mass education system than fundamelly address the two issues above. We <b>NEED</b> conquer others with our ideas and a functioning advanced civilization and society. Something that they may not understand but admire because of our mighty technological awareness. <b>NOT</b> just mighty tools, because a tool can be stolen. While the awareness cannot be stolen but only shared.
<p></p>
Moreover, it is fundamental to notice that "<b>technological awareness</b>" is a composition of two terms which are complementary concepts. An advanced enough technology can be seen as a kind of magic. However, it is about <b>HOW</b>. Instead, the awareness is about <b>WHY</b> and that why cannot be "<i>to impose our god and values to them</i>". For that aim, violence, weapons, wars, robbery had shown to work nicely, up to now. Again "<i>up to now</i>", it doesn't imply "<i>forever</i>" and here we are, why we have to change.
<p></p>
After all, for those who fear change, it is worth quoting this: <b>evolution is not necessary when extinction is an option</b>.
