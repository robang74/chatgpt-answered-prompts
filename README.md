## Q&A dialogs with AI chatbots

A collection of some Q&A dialogs with various AI powered chatbots about different subjects
which get the attention of the media.

**please, notice this**

* I wrote these papers and published them on a github repository in order to track their changes and evolution. Often, I wrote them using the AI as a critical argumentative partner or a peer-review or an antagonist counter-speaker, for example.

* These roles-playing are well-know in the literature as "co-competition", "antagonist collaboration", "adversarial team working", "ideas funneling", "serendipity brainstorming" and "explain to understand" which is "learning by doing" but declined in idea development and refinement area.

* Hence, these papers were NOT written by the AI,  instead the chatbot had a mere assistant role, whatever it was, allowing me to better understand how to explain my idea. Like it was an advanced text editor!

**please, avoid this**

* Stop expecting that the AI would give you a useful answer or even a wise answer. The correct use of an AI, it is not querying it as it were the [Delphi's Oracle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythia), an ancient Greek myth, but as a tool to avoid asking real-living people doing {dumb, boring, repeating} tasks.

* Very skilled people can use the AI also for peer-reviewing a paper, playing a role in a conversation, etc. Those who are also experienced know that the AI is usually failing to summarize a text because it is not even able to identify the concepts expressed in that text that is worth being noticed.

* In fact, the more that ideas are far from the obvious (common-sense vs insightful wisdom) , the more they are statistically left behind by the LLM. And also humans do the same, by the way. Which means that unless a specific pre-training, without a skilled and without  an experienced human driving the chatbot, the AI is just an advanced "*fortune cookies*" messages provider.

**be classic, or else**

* In case you wish not abandon your habit to decide or act on driven by random inputs also known as "*the art of divination*" or "*ghosts' suggestion*", then using the "*traditional*" tools - like reading cards, tea spots in the tea cup, fractal images in coffee grounds, arbitrary recognition of structures in animal entrails - is way lesser energy intensive approach with grants you even better results. Be traditional!

## Download

There are several way to download this github repository:

- using the green button in its homepage and download the [last ZIP archive](https://github.com/robang74/chatgpt-answered-prompts/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)

- choose a tagged release among [those available](https://github.com/robang74/chatgpt-answered-prompts/tags) and download the archive

- clone the repository with the specific `git clone` command, in this way: 
```
git clone https://github.com/robang74/chatgpt-answered-prompts.git
```

The advantage of downloading a tagged release is having an archive 'freezed' by
the author while the ZIP contains the last version uploaded. Instead, the
`git clone` will also provide you with all the information and a complete view
of every change. Click on the link above will submit the related request for you.

## Versioning

One of main goals of `git` and the github web interface is to provide a versioning
control which also means a catalog of every author and changes made by them on
every single file. The list of these changes are named *commits*. Here below the link
related to the commits pushed on this repository:

* https://github.com/robang74/chatgpt-answered-prompts/commits/main/

As you can see, each commit is carry-on a time stamp also. The green label indicates
that also the timestamp is validate by the github infrastructure system which belongs
to Microsoft Corporation. In fact, github cannot validate those timestamps that are
coming from 3rd party systems like the users workstations but just the receiving
time, date and content. However, for most of the cases this is irrelevant.

## Translations

The aim is to provide translations of these .md files in different languages. The translations will be put into a subfolder with the English name of the language in which they have been translated into. The translated .md file will carry a section about how the translation has been made. 

Here below a template in English:

> This document (tag: `$tagstring` or hash: `$hashstring`) has been translated from English into `$language` by a native `$language` speaker who knows English and with the support of `$automatic-tool` to speed up the translation task.

As you can see the translated document should contain a reference about the original version and those which are tagged are the most reliable.

If you wish to send a translation, it is necessary that you know well one of the languages in which this document is available, even better if you know English and can start from the original version, and that you are a native speaker or equivalent in the language in which the translation is being made.
