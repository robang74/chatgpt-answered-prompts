## Download

There are several way to download this github repository:

- using the green button in its homepage and download the [last ZIP archive](https://github.com/robang74/chatgpt-answered-prompts/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)

- choose a tagged release among [those available](https://github.com/robang74/chatgpt-answered-prompts/tags) and download the archive

- clone the repository with the specific `git clone` command, in this way: 
```
git clone https://github.com/robang74/chatgpt-answered-prompts.git
```

The advantage of downloading a tagged release is having an archive 'freezed' by
the author while the ZIP contains the last version uploaded. Instead, the
`git clone` will also provide you with all the information and a complete view
of every change. Click on the link above will submit the related request for you.

## Versioning

One of main goals of `git` and the github web interface is to provide a versioning
control which also means a catalog of every author and changes made by them on
every single file. The list of these changes are named *commits*. Here below the link
related to the commits pushed on this repository:

* https://github.com/robang74/chatgpt-answered-prompts/commits/main/

As you can see, each commit is carry-on a time stamp also. The green label indicates
that also the timestamp is validate by the github infrastructure system which belongs
to Microsoft Corporation. In fact, github cannot validate those timestamps that are
coming from 3rd party systems like the users workstations but just the receiving
time, date and content. However, for most of the cases this is irrelevant.

## Translations

The aim is to provide translations of these .md files in different languages. The translations will be put into a subfolder with the English name of the language in which they have been translated into. The translated .md file will carry a section about how the translation has been made. 

Here below a template in English:

> This document (tag: `$tagstring` or hash: `$hashstring`) has been translated from English into `$language` by a native `$language` speaker who knows English and with the support of `$automatic-tool` to speed up the translation task.

As you can see the translated document should contain a reference about the original version and those which are tagged are the most reliable.

If you wish to send a translation, it is necessary that you know well one of the languages in which this document is available, even better if you know English and can start from the original version, and that you are a native speaker or equivalent in the language in which the translation is being made.
