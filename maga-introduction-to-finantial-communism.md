### Introduction

(**\*!!\***) *Skip this part, if you are interested in the topic but not being introduced to it.*

There is a HUGE difference between those who print money from thin air (paper money) and those who earn money from their work (real money like silver dollars).

The day we have been convinced to trade our silver dollars in exchange for a banknote, we got into the path to reach the point for which the banknote are not anymore convertible back (in silver or gold at the end of Bretton Woods system) then not anymore convertible in anything else valuable (like oil at the end of Saudi Arabia oil for USD agreement) at a fixed price (or at any agreed ratio exchange).

Obviously, we can use USD for buying food at the grocery store or oil from Arabs or gold from jewelries but while we were busy at work earning those banknotes, they printed a lot more of new banknotes from thin air. The banknotes that we got as payment for our work are just a small fraction of those printed.

This explain why the price of gold in USD is increasing as well as the stuff at the grocery stores - lnkd.in/dDk-isCv - despite the mining of gold is constantly increasing lnkd.in/dbe4wYnM - and thus its rarity decreasing.

### Historical perspective

(**\*!!\***) *Skip this part, if you are interested in the topic but not being educated about it.*

Up to this point, printing money by thin air - paper money - can seen as a fraud or a governative scam, only. Nothing new and not so terrible, anyway. For comparison, we can give a look back to our history.

Something which is not so bad, because along with Western history we were used to living with it. Thieves in charge of the State or public power, I mean. Thieves in the Temples were common much time before Jesus Christ kicked them out. The day in which their arrogance overcame their arrogance overcame even His patience, but they had their fierce revenge when Pilato asked the crowd about saving Jesus or Barabba. Also criminals are self-organizing in public or private form, in the aim of over-ruling the others. Nothing really new.

On the other side, this mechanisms can be seen in a positive way, also. It can be seen as a direct way of collecting taxes. For every of transaction a fraction of its value is created in the US federal govt bank account, like a magic that brings defense, law and order, NHS, public transportation, free-of-charge schooling, etc.

Let's say 10%. Like it was used among Ancient Romans. It was 50% during the Dark Ages but in such "mezzadria" was also included the rent for the field to cultivate, the house and everything else on the "glebae" needed for serving it, "glebae servus", in fact. While during the Renaissance it was between 2% and 4% because every attempt to rise over the top of that range  generated popular uprisings.

Pay extreme attention here, in particular, and notice that "mezzadria" was a production tax equivalent to our incoming taxation. While "decima" among Romans and the 2%-4% rate during the Renaissance period, were patrimonial taxation.

In fact, while the lord of "glebae servus" was able to establish how much people living and working on his lands were producing, Romans and Renaissance lords did not care about labour production or they were not able to account for it. So, they came in arms and took a fraction of the value of all our belongings or our lives, just in case we were resisting too much.

Hence, pass to the posterity the old says by St. Augustine (5th century a.C.), who states that 

kingdoms without justice are mere robberies, and robberies are like small kingdoms, but large Empires are piracy writ large.

Hence creating more than 2%-4% of thin air money in the govt bank accout by a sort of magic for each transaction would be enough to run a civilized state and with 10% a great empire like Romans ruled for centuries.

At least, before late Jesus followers - those spared being eaten by the ferocious beasts of the circus - did convinced "patrizi" the Romans in charge of the State - usually public servants like we are used to call them, nowadays - to care more about their souls' sins rather than be practical men in ruling power and administrate fair justice.

Let me be clear about "patrizi" habits (or sins): orgies feasts were a common among them as much homosexuality, promiscuous marriage, incestuous sexual intercourse, cross-dressing, all-naked saunas and baths, drinking wine with honey, plus whatever other activities highly educated and civilized humans wishing to enjoy when they are totally free to do so.

About two centuries after having accepted not to deal with Jesus' followers like mad-dogs good only to be the lion's food in the circus, they started to impose Christianity as the only true Roman Empire word of God and almost all the rest of the world decided to move in arms toward Rome and cut their freak heads.

Nowadays, we discovered that among many joyful habits, "patrizi" were used to dissolve lead into red wine to make it more blood-like in its color. Doing so, they were poisoning their bodies and their minds, in particular. Hence, for the time barbarians were knocking at the Rome doors with their clubs, they were incapable of defending themselves, also. 

Good bye, great empire!

Because the God forgives sinners but not the idiots. These ones cannot be saved even by His merciful love for the human beings. Because natural selection is needed by human beings, until and as long as they are made of matter which cannot be perfect or even near the perfection. Natural selection is nothing else than negative feed-back in the system controlling theory.

Order is order and it has its own laws.

### American imperialism

(**\*!!\***) *Skip this part, if you don't give a sh*t about the rest of the world or you just know.*

While US grocery stores are enforced by law to accept USD banknotes or credit cards, Arabs are not enforced by US law in favour of the FED paper money as legal tender.

Arabs, like every other person on this planet, can refuse to exchange goods for USD. Unless they get bombed in their heads and children's heads until they change that idea. Still, without an agreement, the oil price is made by "the market" and the market knows. Hence the price rises, unless constantly bombing someone to lower the price and the rest of the world demands.
