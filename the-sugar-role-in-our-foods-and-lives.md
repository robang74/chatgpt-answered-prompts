#### PROMPT #1

Compare high fructose corn syrup and sugar from canes or other vegetables (the tablespoon sugar, in common grocery, sucrose) about the their ability to sweeten a water-based drink (e.g. grams for liter to obtain the same sweet taste) and the calories provided to human body in digesting them (e.g. kcal for each gram of product). For a reference put also in this comparison pure Aspartame and the compound (a mix of sweeteners) which is mostly used in the market today.

#### CHATGPT #1

Certainly! Here's a comparative overview of **High Fructose Corn Syrup (HFCS)**, **Table Sugar (Sucrose)**, **Pure Aspartame**, and a **Common Sweetener Blend** regarding their sweetness potency in water-based drinks and their caloric contributions.

#### **1. Overview of Sweeteners**

- **Table Sugar (Sucrose):**
  - **Source:** Extracted from sugar cane or sugar beets.
  - **Composition:** A disaccharide composed of glucose and fructose (1:1 ratio).
  - **Usage:** Widely used in beverages, baking, and general sweetening.

- **High Fructose Corn Syrup (HFCS):**
  - **Source:** Derived from corn starch.
  - **Composition:** Varies, commonly HFCS-55 (55% fructose, 45% glucose) used in soft drinks.
  - **Usage:** Predominantly used in processed foods and beverages as a sweetener.

- **Pure Aspartame:**
  - **Source:** Synthetic sweetener.
  - **Composition:** Composed of two amino acids, aspartic acid and phenylalanine.
  - **Usage:** Used in low-calorie and diet beverages, as well as tabletop sweeteners.

- **Common Sweetener Blends:**
  - **Source:** Combination of multiple high-intensity sweeteners.
  - **Composition:** Often includes aspartame, acesulfame potassium (Ace-K), sucralose, and others.
  - **Usage:** Designed to mimic the sweetness profile of sugar while minimizing calories, used in various diet and "zero-calorie" products.

#### **2. Comparative Table**

| **Sweetener**           | **Relative Sweetness to Sucrose** | **Grams Needed per Liter for Equivalent Sweetness** | **Calories per Gram** | **Total Calories per Liter** |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|------------------------------|
| **Sucrose (Table Sugar)** | 1x                                 | ~100 grams                                           | 4 kcal/g              | ~400 kcal                    |
| **High Fructose Corn Syrup (HFCS)** | ~1.1x                              | ~90 grams                                            | 4 kcal/g              | ~360 kcal                    |
| **Pure Aspartame**      | ~200x                              | ~0.5 grams                                           | 4 kcal/g              | ~2 kcal                      |
| **Common Sweetener Blend** | ~300-700x (varies based on blend) | ~0.14 - 0.33 grams                                   | ~4 kcal/g              | ~0.56 - 1.32 kcal            |

#### **3. Detailed Breakdown**

**Sucrose (Table Sugar)**

- **Sweetness:** Baseline (1x). It serves as the standard for measuring other sweeteners.
- **Usage:** Approximately 100 grams per liter (g/L) are needed to achieve desired sweetness in water-based drinks.
- **Calories:** Provides about 4 kilocalories (kcal) per gram, totaling roughly 400 kcal per liter.

**High Fructose Corn Syrup (HFCS)**

- **Sweetness:** Slightly sweeter than sucrose (~1.1 times). This means less HFCS is needed compared to sucrose to achieve the same sweetness.
- **Usage:** Around 90 grams per liter are typically required.
- **Calories:** Similar to sucrose, HFCS provides approximately 4 kcal per gram, totaling about 360 kcal per liter.

**Pure Aspartame**

- **Sweetness:** Approximately 200 times sweeter than sucrose.
- **Usage:** Only about 0.5 grams per liter are needed to match the sweetness of sucrose.
- **Calories:** While aspartame contains about 4 kcal per gram, the total caloric contribution is minimal (~2 kcal per liter) due to the small amounts used.

**Common Sweetener Blends**

- **Sweetness:** Varies widely, typically ranging from 300 to 700 times sweeter than sucrose depending on the specific blend.
- **Usage:** Typically between 0.14 to 0.33 grams per liter are required to achieve equivalent sweetness.
- **Calories:** Despite having similar caloric content per gram as sucrose and HFCS (~4 kcal/g), the total calories contributed are negligible (~0.56 to 1.32 kcal per liter) because of the minimal quantities used.

#### **4. Practical Implications**

- **Sweetness Efficiency:** High-intensity sweeteners like aspartame and sweetener blends provide the same level of sweetness as sucrose with significantly lower quantities, making them highly efficient for reducing sugar content in beverages.
  
- **Caloric Impact:** While sucrose and HFCS contribute substantially to the caloric content of beverages, pure aspartame and sweetener blends contribute negligibly, which is beneficial for calorie-restricted diets.

- **Taste Profile:** Sweetener blends are often used to replicate the taste profile of sucrose more closely and mitigate any aftertastes associated with individual high-intensity sweeteners.

#### **5. Additional Considerations**

- **Metabolic Effects:** While not covered in detail here, it's important to note that different sweeteners can have varying effects on metabolism, insulin response, and gut health. For instance, excessive consumption of HFCS has been linked to various metabolic disorders, whereas artificial sweeteners like aspartame are often debated regarding their long-term health impacts.

- **Regulatory Status:** All mentioned sweeteners are approved for use by major health authorities (e.g., FDA, EFSA) when consumed within acceptable daily intake levels.

#### **6. Conclusion**

When formulating or choosing sweetened beverages:

- **Sucrose and HFCS** provide similar levels of sweetness and caloric content, with HFCS being slightly sweeter and slightly lower in grams needed per liter.
  
- **Pure Aspartame** offers a high sweetness potency with virtually no caloric impact, suitable for low-calorie or diet beverages.

- **Common Sweetener Blends** leverage multiple high-intensity sweeteners to achieve desired sweetness with minimal caloric contribution, often enhancing the overall taste profile compared to single sweeteners.

This comparison underscores the trade-offs between sweetness intensity, caloric content, and flavor profiles when selecting sweeteners for water-based drinks.

#### PROMPT #2

Produce a table in which 35 grams of sugar which is the amount of sugar found into a 33cl Coca-Cola's can (as far as I know due to a Google search, but feel free to adjust that value in a more precise way keeping the gram as metric) is compared with the calories need for children and adults, men and women, sedentary life and active workforce life, in term of percentage of the daily calories needed. Plus put also in that confrontation how much common foods in grams should be eaten for reaching the same amount. Suggested foods: banana, apple, orange, potato, carrot, bean, beef, egg, milk, bread, pasta (without any sauce), boiled rice (without any sauce), salmon, tuna fish (raw not under oil), butter and olive oil.

This comparison highlights how much common foods you would need to consume to reach the same caloric intake as found in 35 grams of sugar (140 kcal), which is equivalent to what's in a 33cl Coca-Cola can. Additionally, it shows what percentage of daily caloric needs this amount of sugar represents for different groups.

<br/>

### CONSIDERATIONS

For assuming the same amount of calories contained in 35 grams of sugar that is contained in a can of original taste Coca-Cola 33cl can, on average, is needed 144 grams of food which is 4.1x more in sugar weight. While a Coca-Cola can contains c.a. 365 grams of liquid (water 330 gr. + sugar 35 gr in the water volume). This makes Coca-Cola being equivalent to apples in terms of calories vs weight of food ratio (42 kcal / 100 ml). Do you think that a solution of 10% of sugar into water can provide all the nutrients of the same amount of apples?  

**Output Check**

* In particular, we know that LLMs usually are very bad in math and also arithmetic. Before anything else I am going to check the values in the food tables because the others tables are just a list of standard values which have not math.
* So, the food table is the one at risk. In fact, apples have 52 kcal as Google search first answered while it is easy to find that different apple varieties provide different nutrients and thus energy amounts (between 38 and 70 kcal).
* However, we can take 52 as an average. Surprisingly, the chatbot did well with apples. Also 400 kcal for 100 grams of sugar implies 140 kcal for 35 grams.

This bring us to calculate the minimal and the maximum weight of food which are related to the diets listed above:

- lightest diet	1.65 Kg	
- activiest diet 2.88 Kg

However, we need to notice that 2 cans of Coca-Cola original taste with 35 grams of sugar in it, will provide 17% of the calories needed for a sedentary school-home kid living in a city and just 10% for an adult male involved into a workforce activity.

Unfortunately, calories are just an aspect of a human diet. All that food brings a lot of nutrients among which vitamins, proteins and fibers.

Hence a workforce adult male can drink two cans at day and still receive enought nutrients from the other 90% of its food (2.88 Kg).

While on the opposite side (1.65 Kg) a 17% of the nutrients are eliminated or 17% more calories are added on the daily nutritionial diet.

This clearly has a HUGE impact on sedentary school-home kid livings in a city and less on those people that are consuming a lot of energy.
